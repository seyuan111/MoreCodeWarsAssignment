//Find the first non-consecutive number

//Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
//By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element
//of the array.

//E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are
//all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

//If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

//The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be
//numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order.
//The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive
//could be either too!

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
    const curr = arr[i];

//No oddities here

//Write a small function that returns the values of an array that are
//not odd.

//All values in the array will be integers. Return the good values in the
//order they are given.

function noOdds( values ){

//Partial Keys

//The Rub

//You need to make a function that takes an object as an argument, and
//returns a very similar object but with a special property. The returned
//object should allow a user to access values by providing only the
//beginning of the key for the value they want. For example if the given
//object has a key idNumber, you should be able to access its value on the
//returned object by using a key idNum or even simply id. Num and Number
//shouldn't work because we are only looking for matches at the beginning
//of a key.

//Be aware that you could simply add all these partial keys one by one to
//the object. However, for the sake of avoiding clutter, we don't want to
//have a JSON with a bunch of nonsensical keys. Thus, in the random tests
//there will be a test to check that you did not add or remove any keys
//from the object passed in or the object returned.

//Also, if a key is tested that appears as the beginning of more than one
//key in the original object (e.g. if the original object had a key idNumber
//and idString and we wanted to test the key id) then return the value
//corresponding with whichever key comes first alphabetically.
//(In this case it would be idNumbers value because it comes first
//alphabetically.)

//Example

//let o = partialKeys({ abcd: 1 })

//o.abcd === 1 // true
//o.abc === 1 // true
//o.ab === 1 // true
//o.a === 1 // true

function partialKeys(obj) {
  return new Proxy(obj, {
    get: (obj, prop) => {
      const key = Object.keys(obj).sort().find(x => x.startsWith(prop));
      return key ? obj[key] : undefined;
    }
  });
}

//The alphabet product

//I have four positive integers, A, B, C and D, where A < B < C < D. The
//input is a list of the integers A, B, C, D, AxB, BxC, CxD, DxA in some
//order. Your task is to return the value of D.

function alphabet(ns) {
  const sorted = ns.sort((a,b) => a-b)
  for(let i = 2; i<sorted.length;i++){
    if(sorted[i] == sorted[0] * sorted[1]){
      [sorted[i],sorted[4]] = [sorted[4],sorted[i]]
    }
  }
    if(sorted[2] > sorted[3]){
